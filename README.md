# MotherWeb.net
A multi-cloud, multi-language, and multi-container service designed for passion projects, art, educational resources, data collection, and product development serving both personal and professional collaborations.

The ultimate goal of this project is to have a domain w/ subdomains for members' applications, portfolios or stores. They will either be able to use a default iteration of motherweb into their needs or update/create their own site from scratch. 

Utilizing 3 major cloud services is not only for database stability and security but so that anyone using motherweb has access to *all* major benefits of each big player/competitor in the cloud industry with the ease of interacting with a gui(graphic user interface).

This is a project started by Ashlynn Rose Conradson as way to serve her ambitions for community contribution and personal development while practicing intergrating different services, languages, technologies and libraries.
